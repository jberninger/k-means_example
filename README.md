# k-means_example

Here is some annotated code that I helped develop for a k-means clustering analysis of voting precincts in Los Angeles County.
We used the hourly turnout at the voting centers to to cluster the precincts
I have not included that datasets, but I have included all the code, broken down into the essential steps

Will get a fully reproducible example online when I find some extra time :)
